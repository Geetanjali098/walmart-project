## Walmart USA Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program on Forage - March 2025

  • Developed a novel version of a heap data structure in Java for Walmart's shipping department, showcasing strong problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
  • Designed a UML class diagram for a data processor, considering different operating modes and database connections.
  • Created an entity relationship diagram to design a new database accounting for all requirements provided by Walmart's pet department.
  • Insert data into an SQLite database.
  • Writing a Python script to read rows from spreadsheets, extract relevant data, format it for the database, and insert it into the database`,


    These contributions showcase a powerful blend of algorithmic thinking, database design, and data processing expertise. Here are some benefits of this work:

### **1. Optimized Data Handling**
- The novel heap implementation in Java improves efficiency in Walmart's shipping department, optimizing how shipment data is managed and prioritized.
- Faster processing leads to improved logistics and better inventory tracking.

### **2. Structured & Scalable Design**
- The UML class diagram helps in creating a clear blueprint for system behavior, reducing future design inconsistencies and easing integration with different operating modes and databases.
- The entity relationship diagram ensures the new database is well-structured, scalable, and aligned with Walmart’s pet department’s operational needs.

### **3. Seamless Data Storage & Retrieval**
- Inserting data into an SQLite database ensures that information is stored systematically, reducing redundancy and improving retrieval speed.
- This enhances data integrity and makes querying more efficient.

### **4. Automated & Efficient Data Processing**
- The Python script automates spreadsheet processing, eliminating manual data entry errors, ensuring consistency, and enabling large-scale data transfers effortlessly.
- It allows smooth integration between different data formats and ensures structured inputs into Walmart’s database.

### **5. Business Impact & Operational Efficiency**
- These improvements collectively enhance Walmart’s operations, reducing time spent on managing shipments and pet department records.
- The automation and database optimizations contribute to cost savings and better inventory oversight.

This work highlights a strong capability in **problem-solving, database structuring, and automation**, all of which are invaluable in large-scale retail and logistics environments.
